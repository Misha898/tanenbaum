This is my personal project for learning operating systems, networks and computer design
I'll name it Tanenbaum

I use stm32f407vet6 mcu with FreeRTOS, LwIP, tinyusb, LL(Low Level) device drivers

I build it without using STM32CubeMX and HAL
(I can talk eight hours straight why I've come to such decision)

Also used provided by MCU's support package files such as linker script,
asm startup file, CMSIS regs definitions

I use CMake for building (gcc-arm-none-eabi toolchain)

Also in file Src/newlib_syscall.c implemented (partially yet)
syscalls for newlib_nano library (it is libc for embedded systems)

Commands to build project:
$ ./build
$ make -C Build/
